# Mario
Toward the beginning of World 1-1 in Nintendoâ€™s Super Mario Brothers, Mario must hop over adjacent pyramids of blocks, per the below.

I've recreated those pyramids in C, albeit in text, using hashes (#) for bricks, a la the below. Each hash is a bit taller than it is wide, so the pyramids themselves are also be taller than they are wide.

The program I wrote is called mario. And it allows the user to decide just how tall the pyramids should be by first prompting them for a positive integer between 1 and 8, inclusive.
